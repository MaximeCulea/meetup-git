[BBQ Pro](https://plugin-planet.com/bbq-pro/) helps keep your WordPress site safe and secure by blocking attacks and bad requests. This helps to conserve precious server resources like memory and bandwidth. BBQ Pro is built to be extensible, flexible, and blazing fast. It checks all incoming traffic and quietly blocks any URI requests that contain nasty stuff like `eval(`, `base64(`, `exec(`, and other malicious nonsense. BBQ Pro is fully customizable, giving you control over every pattern and rule. You can edit, remove, add, and/or test BBQ patterns via easy-to-use settings screens.

**GDPR**

This plugin does not collect any user data. So it does _not_ do anything to make your site _less_ compliant with GDPR. I have done my best to ensure that this plugin is 100% GDPR compliant, but I'm not a lawyer so can't guarantee anything. To determine if your site is GDPR compliant, please consult an attorney.
